# WEB102 Prework - *Sea Monster CrowdFunding*

Submitted by: **Sumaiya Fatemae**

**Sea Monster Crowdfunding** is a website for the company Sea Monster Crowdfunding that displays information about the games they have funded.

This was a project completed under CodePath's Web 102 prework! 

Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [x] The introduction section explains the background of the company and how many games remain unfunded.
* [x] The Stats section includes information about the total contributions and dollars raised as well as the top two most funded games.
* [x] The Our Games section initially displays all games funded by Sea Monster Crowdfunding
* [x] The Our Games section has three buttons that allow the user to display only unfunded games, only funded games, or all games.

The following **optional** features are implemented:
* [x] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app functionality!


**Some Future Features I would like to include **

* The ability for a User to get more information about a game they want to explore by clicking on a game in the game-card
* A log in page so the app is able to save information about where and how much a user has donated to a game before


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a cool GIF of the website:

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
* I had a tough time understanding reduce in Javascript. It was a new concept and I was unfamiliar with how the synthax worked. With some trial and error, I was able to grasp what a useful feature it was

*A huge obstacle I had was using games instead of GAMES_JSON when calling functions. I did not realize I had a variable called GAMES_JSON for a while which resulted in me not seeing the outcomes I wanted to.
